Trace the route’s of the global shipping industry, add some color and you’d have a continental map that gives early satellite imagery a run for it’s money. <!--more-->

As I write this post I type on a keyboard made in China, I wear cotton sewn in India and I drink from a glass produced in Japan - all of which arrived in the US on the global conveyor belt that is the international shipping industry. 

For all of the hits that the industry - and subsequent supply chains - took following an increase in global trade restrictions due to the pandemic, over 90% of the worlds goods spend some part of their lifetime in a container aboard a cargo ship. On top of that, there are at least 20 million containers on the way to their destination at this moment in time and the industry represents the biggest method of transportation on the planet.

The last time global shipping made major news was when the Ever Given became wedged in-between the banks of the Suez Canal. This catastrophe alone cost global trade between \$6 to \$10 billion a week according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-suezcanal-ship-costs/suez-canal-blockage-could-cost-6-billion-to-10-billion-in-lost-trade-allianz-idUSKBN2BI261), causing global shipping rates for fuel tankers to soar and having such a widespread influence that it moved the needle for annual trade growth back fifty basis points.

Recently, however, the industry is making news following a wave of advancements in autonomous technology. Events hosted by the [International Maritime Organization](https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Autonomous-shipping.aspx) (IMO) in April and September last year aimed to provide a regulatory framework around the operation of ‘Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships or ‘MASS’ - with the aim to have a fully-fledged code by 1 January, 2028. Currently, MASS’ are being trialed in some areas for shorter voyages, but with the broader legal and ethical scope regarding their “interactions with ports, pilotage, responses to incidents, safety, security and protection of the marine environment” still yet to be fully addressed, widespread adoption is still few years out. 

[Captain AI](https://www.captainai.com/) is one such company that is pioneering the development of “autonomous ships for autonomous ports.” Based in the largest port on the European continent in Rotterdam, the company uses deep learning techniques, high-fidelity simulations and a suite of advanced sensors to model the 3D world around its vessels as they embark on their journeys. Securing 340k of funding in its seed round in 2019, It will be interesting to see how Captain AI continues to develop and position itself in the broader autonomous shipping market.
