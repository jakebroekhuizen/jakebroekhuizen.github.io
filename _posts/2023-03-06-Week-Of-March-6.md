### Open Banking, Welfare Algorithms, Kitchen Table Economics and Poker Faces

<!--more-->

#### **What I’m reading**

#### [The rise of kitchen table economics](https://www.ft.com/content/e53e4b14-4653-4b6e-a72f-d50f75e97cb7){:target="_blank"} 

On tackling competition policy from a different angle, where technocratic political decision-making faces a more grounded, “kitchen-table” sensibility of the way antitrust laws should be structured throughout the US. 

#### [Open banking startup Abound nabs $601M to supercharge its AI-based consumer lending platform](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/06/open-banking-loans-platform-abound-nabs-601m-to-supercharge-its-consumer-lending-business/){:target="_blank"} 

On open banking, where for the startup Abound, user transaction data is fed into AI-Based algorithms that CEO Gerald Chappel says is used to create “financial x-rays” that generate it’s own form of credit scores. With a 30% increase of it’s small scale (**£**1,000 - **£**10,000) lending service month-on-month, Abounds growth is indicative of a broader trend of the increase in demand from average consumers to find alternative methods to bolster their monthly income.

On the rise of “BlackLotus” - a piece of malware that for the first time in 12 years has found a way to circumvent the industry-standard protection of the firmware that is first to run when a computer is powered on. Windows machines running fully updated windows OS are vulnerable. It isn’t clear who is behind the malware, but if a device is located in Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia or Kazakhstan, it is prevented from running…

#### [This Algorithm Could Ruin Your Life](https://www.wired.com/story/welfare-algorithms-discrimination/){:target="_blank"} 

On systemic biases arising within an algorithm that Rotterdam in the Netherlands uses in it’s welfare fraud investigation office. Despite being trained on nearly 13,000 historical cases, a set of characteristics including being young, a parent, not fluent in Dutch or a woman emerged on a non-deterministic level. Following the reading I did [earlier](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/06/open-banking-loans-platform-abound-nabs-601m-to-supercharge-its-consumer-lending-business/) on the use of machine learning algorithms in determining an equivalent metric to a persons credit score, two broader questions are raised about the size of datasets needed as inputs into these models who’s output can be so life-altering, as well as the wider set of ethical standards that go into algorithm design.

#### [When — and How — to Keep a Poker Face at Work](https://hbr.org/2023/03/when-and-how-to-keep-a-poker-face-at-work){:target="_blank"} 

On how to strategically regulate your facial expressions and body language to “revive morale, inspire trust, and create a positive work environment.”
