[Really interesting read]([https://www.ft.com/content/e53e4b14-4653-4b6e-a72f-d50f75e97cb7](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/)){:target="_blank"}  on the partnership between ServiceNow Research and Hugging Face in creating a royalty-free code-generating LLM that "matches or outperforms the AI model from OpenAI that was used to power initial versions of Copilot." Its royalty-free usage and compute power are exciting milestones in the BigCode project that ServiceNow and Hugging Face launched late last year.
