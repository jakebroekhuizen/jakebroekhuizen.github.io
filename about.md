<img src="/assets/img/Headshot.png" alt="Image Description" class="about-img">

My name is Jake Broekhuizen and I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Here I was exposed to, and given hands-on experience with, some of the building blocks of the modern day technologies that we interact with in our day-to-day lives.

I’m currently working as a Business Systems Analyst at ServiceNow and have previously worked as a Systems Architect and Technical Program Manager within the recycling and renewable energy industry. I also taught the fundamentals of programming and computer science in parallel to studying for my undergraduate degree at Berkeley.

I feel that my time at Berkeley created a window into the world of technology and it’s applications in the modern world that I want to spend more time looking through. This site is my attempt to continue to develop new perspectives, to review the things that excite me in the fields of tech and finance and to hopefully have some fun along the way.
